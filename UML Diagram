UML(Unified Modeling Language):-The main aim of UML is to define a standard way to visualize the way a system has been designed.
                                It is quite similar to blueprints used in other fields of engineering. UML is not a programming language, it is rather a visual language.
  Types:-
    1>Structural(Static)- classes, objects, components, and their relationships, providing a clear view of the system's architecture.(7 Types, Class Diagram is important)
    2>Behavioural(Dynamic)- depict the dynamic aspects of a system, illustrating how objects interact and behave over time in response to events.(7 types, Sequence Diagram is important)

  Access Modifies Recap:-
    public:-everywhere
    private:-within the same class
    protected:-within the class and child class

  Class Diagram-static structure of a system by showing system's classes, their methods and attributes. Class diagrams also help us identify relationship between different classes or objects.

    Protected:- is represented by #

    2> Assosiation / Connection
        Types:-
          Class Assosiation(Inheritance------->, is-a relationship)
          Object Assosiation(has-a relation ,Simple Assosiation, Aggregation(Week relation, sofa-----diamond Room), Composition(Strong Relation, seat-------solid diamond chair))


  Sequence Diagram:-simply depicts interaction between objects in a sequential order i.e. the order in which these interactions take place.
